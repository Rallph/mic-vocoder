Mic-vocoder takes the Windows audio input/output devices that are currently in use and streams the data from one to the other. 
This is the frame for a middle step of changing the inputed audios frequencies, and other variables, to user liking.

Development Progress Steps:
[X] Get Input Device 
[X] Get Output Device
[X] Initialization and Prep of Devices
[ ] Shared buffer getting/loading/releasing
[ ] Audio out
[ ] Vocode audio
[ ] Output vocoded audio. 
[ ] Simple GUI (reach idea)
[ ] GUI manipulation inputs/toggles (reach idea)
[ ] Package/Imaging (reach idea)
[ ] Success!


Windows audio stuff is really complicated and layers of interfaces. 
Took far longer reading through documentation than actually being able to debug and code.
This has been a good start into making this functional, but time allotment, sleep, and previous commitments stop us here today.
